M: Length of list 1

N: Length of list 2

TimePoints: 100 long array of paired ints



My Pseudocode;
# Check that the list is sorted

# Work through and remove any sub-events, and combine overlapping ones into just one

# Work through the list, for each item, compare the end time to the next one's end time, if gap then free
